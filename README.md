# Portifolio Project

## This is the second nanodegree's full stack course projectt

Goal: You will be provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete throughout the course of your Nanodegree program.

## Methodologies

For this project I tried to use the BEM methodology for writting clean code. If you want to know more about it see the link below:
